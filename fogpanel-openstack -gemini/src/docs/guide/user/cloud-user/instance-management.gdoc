*Instance-management*
   
       Fogpanel provides instance management operations for users. Instance may 
be stop, start, reboot, destroy,restore etc..

In fogpanel instances are in following state:
 

#Once a Instance is destroyed, it cannot be recovered. All the resources used by 
the Instance will be reclaimed by the fogpanel. 
#A stop action will attempt to gracefully shutdown the operating system, 
which typically involves terminating all the running applications.
#Using force stop option to stopped vm. Use this option the operation system 
cannot be stopped, it will be forcefully terminated.This has the same effect as 
pulling the power card to a physical machine.This may cause harddisk to
corrputed.
#A reboot is a stop followed by a start.
 
#User delete instance. That delete instance status is changed to destroyed. 
If user want back that deleted Instance.It use option restored, To back 
instance without loss of any data. Because user do delete option instance 
is go to destroyed state. Normally it not destroyed. At period of time it is in 
destroyed state. This time is setup in cloudstack. If that time expire.
It automatically expunged.

*Create Instance*

   Instance are usually created from a template. Template is a file that contain
operating system image also you need to select Instance hostname,computation,
firewall and optionally you can choose secondary harddisk. Computation plan  are 
classified into differenet types based on cpu and memory capacity.

 To create a instance:
* Log in to the Fogpanel UI.
* In menu, click cloud then Instance.
* then Click create Vm.
* select Displayname(Hostname),Hypervisor type,computation-plan,template etc.then Click Submit 
and your Instance will be created and started.
 (Note:- You need to setup Display name manually in virtual machine also
Storage type contains two technology shared SAN like storage, Local Disk
attach to hypervisor server also computation plans are load based on your OS
minimal system requirement)

*Accessing Instance*
 
To access created Instance or VM through the FogPanel UI:

 * Log in to the Fogpanel UI.
 * Click cloud menu then Instances, then click the name of a running VM.
 * It redirect to instance management page, from that page you click 
the start Console button to access the virtual machine or you can use virtual 
machine primary ip to access virtual machine.

*Instance Actions*

User can perform following action in their Instance:
    
  * Stop,start,restart,restore,delete,attach/detach-iso`s,start console( use to
connect vm)
   
  * To change Computation Plan for instance. User must stop  instance to 
upgrade/downgrade their instance computation plan.
   
  * Show password - To show running vm password,
    
  * Reset password - Instance must be stopped to reset Instance password. 
After password is reset user click show password to view the reset password.
       
  * Change Hostname -  After hostname is changed user must reboot instance,
 so that new hostname to take effect.
         
  * Firewall - Option to open/close (tcp,udp,icmp) inbound and outbound ports 
for instance traffic. This enhance security of virtual machine.
        
  * Vmstatics- show instance current usage of cpu,Bandwidth,disk-i/o etc..
    
  * Addvolume - Option to add secondary disk for Instance.
    
  * Aquireip/release ip - Option to aquire/release secondary ips for a Instance. 
User must add those aquired ip in their instance manually.
        
  * Ssh-key Manager- Use to regenerate ssh key for virtual machine.
     
  * Vm-snapshot - Option to snapshot Instance. This snapshot include both root 
and data disks datas. Once vm snapshot is created user is unable to perform 
any disk action like create disk,attack disk,detach disk. User may delete vm,
their vm-snapshot is delete automatically.

  * Snapshot -User perform snapshot for both root disk and data disk separately.
 
  * Attach/detach iso-  If user vm may crash. User attach live cd iso to their 
vm using this option to recover the crash vm.
