  Computation is a set of virtual hardware features such as CPU core count and 
speed, memory.fogpanel administrator can set up various
plans based on computation elements and hypervisor types. 
End users choose hypervisor type in create vm page the associate plans avaliable 
for that hypervisor type are loading in the create-VM page. Currently fogpanel 
support two type of hypervisors xenserver and kvm by default. 
In future we increase that lists.

h3. Create computation plans:

 Login into Fogpanel as admin user in menu select services 
then click computation and use add offering to create computation plans. 
 
{code}
 A computation plan include two elements:

  # Technical info
  # Billing info 
{code}
!adminguide/services/3.png!

 *Technical info*

            It allow admin users to choose hardware elements capacity in cloud
infra. It contain the following options:

  Zone: In Listing select zone you want to create this offering  
  Name:  Any desired name for the service offering. 
  Description: A short description of the offering that can be displayed to users 
  Storage type:The type of storage technology that should be allocated.It contain two types. 
  Local - It allocates from storage attached directly to the host. 
  Shared - It allocates from storage from shared storage like san,nfs etc...
  Hosttag: (Optional) Any tags that you use to organize your hosts 
  Storage tag:The tags that should be associated with the primary storage.
  Vcpucore: The number of cores which should be allocated to Instance with this offering.
  Speed(mhz):The CPU speed of the cores that the Instance is allocated. 
  Memory: The amount of memory in megabytes that the Instance should be allocated.
  For example 2048 would provide for a 2 GB RAM allocation. 
  N/W rate(MB):Allowed data transfer rate in MB per second. e.g 10 mb/s,100 mb/s or 1000 mb/s 
  B/W(GB): Free of bandwidth allocated for this Plan
  Base os: which os you want to run this plan linux or windows
  Hypervisor: xenserver or kvm, select any one of hypervisor.
  Cpu cap:Whether to limit the level of CPU usage even if spare capacity is available. 
  Offer ha:If yes, the administrator can choose to have the Instance be monitored 
and as highly available as possible. 
  Disk Read Rate: Allowed disk read rate in bits per second.
  Disk Write Rate: Allowed disk write rate in bits per second.
  Disk Read Rate: Allowed disk read rate in IOPS (input/output operations per second).
 Disk Write Rate: Allowed disk write rate in IOPS (input/output operations per second).

*Billing info*

   It allow admin users to code price for hardware element choose. It contain
following elements:

  Vm-Running cost per Month: Cost of running Instance 
  Vm-Stoppage cost per Month: Instance is stopped for a month. Stoppage cost is apply 
for that Instance based on this value. Because it accumulate resource in cloud.
  Setup Cost: One time charge apply for Instance during first billing cycle.
  ok/cancel:  To add computation plan

h3. Manage computation plans*

  Admin user have option to enable,disable and delete plans in computation.
Disable plan is not show in Userpanel.In List page it shown status of plans.Also
it include overall stat for created plans.

 *List page contain following stats:*

Total computation offering: Total created compute offering for all zones.
Enabled computation offering: Enabled compute offering stats for all zones.
disabled computation offering: Disabled compute offering for all zones
  
*Edit/delete computation plans*

    To edit existing offerings. Admin user can change computation plan name,desc 
and billing charges,The updated billing cost will affect in next billing cycle 
for all user.admin users are unable to edit Technical info elements.

view: Use option view to edit computation plan.

Disable/Enable: Use this option to enable/disable compute offering.

You can disable offerings. That disable offerings not list for users.

Delete: Option to delete offering.

{note}
Computation based are classified based on ZONE and hypervisor types.
