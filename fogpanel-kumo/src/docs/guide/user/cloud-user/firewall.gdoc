 Firewall filter Instance incoming and outgoing public internet traffic 
according to a set of rules, called INBOUND and OUTBOUND rules. 
These rules filter network traffic according to the IP address that is 
attempting to communicate with the instance.You can modify firewall by deleting 
or adding any number of inbound and outbound rules. When you do, 
the new rules apply to Instance, whether running or stopped.
If no inbound/outbound rules are specified, then no traffic will be allowed in, 
except for responses to any traffic that has been allowed out through an egress rule. 
In Fog-Panel firewall is based on a Instance. At time of instance creation 
firewall and rules are pre-applied.

* Log in to the FogPanel UI.
		
* In the menu, choose cloud/Firewall
		
* In list view, choose firewall associated to vm, then click the Manage-Port.
		
* To add an inbound rule,click the inbound tab and fill out the following fields 
to specify what network traffic is allowed into VM instances in this firewall. 
If no inbound rules are specified, then no traffic will be allowed in, 
except for responses to any traffic that has been allowed out through an 
egress rule.

* Options inside inbound rule*
	
* Add by CIDR:-
 
     It indicate whether the source of the traffic will be defined by IP address 
(CIDR).
		
*Protocol:-
		
 The networking protocol that sources will use to send traffic to the firewall. 
TCP and UDP are typically used for data exchange and end-user communications. 
ICMP is typically used to send error messages or network monitoring data.
		
*Start Port, End Port. (TCP, UDP only):- A range of listening ports that are the 
destination for the incoming traffic. If you are opening a single port, 
use the same number in both fields.
		
*ICMP Type, ICMP Code. (ICMP only):- The type of message and error code that 
will be accepted.
		
*CIDR (Add by CIDR only):- To accept only traffic from IP addresses within a 
particular address block, enter a CIDR or a comma-separated list of CIDRs. 
The CIDR is the base IP address of the incoming traffic. 
For example, 192.168.0.0/22. To allow all CIDRs, set to 0.0.0.0/0.
