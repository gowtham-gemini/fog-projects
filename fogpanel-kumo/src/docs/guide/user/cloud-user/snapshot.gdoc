  Fogpanel support two types of snapshot  those are:
    
     # Disk snapshots
     # VM snapshots
 
 *Disk snapshot*

  Fogpanel supports snapshots of disk volumes( Both root-disk and data-disk). 
Snapshots are a point-in-time capture of Instance disks. Users can create 
snapshots manually,snapshots of both root disks and data disks are supported 
also user can create volumes from snapshots.

*Snapshot management*

*Create snapshot*

* Log in to the FogPanel UI.
* In the menu, click cloud/snapshot.
* Click *CREATE SNAPSHOT* provide the following details,
Volume list: Select volume you want to snapshot(It list both root disk and data
disk volumes, Root disk volume name are mentioned by default.It start with 
ROOT-NUMBERIC).
Then click ok. The snapshot for volume is created and listed.
 
 *Delete snapshot*

* Log in to the FogPanel UI.
* In the menu, click cloud/snapshot.
* In list view new and old snapshot are listed. You can choose sanpshot and use 
action button delete in selected snapshot to delete it.

 
*Create volumes from snapshot*

* Log in to the FogPanel UI.
* In the menu, click cloud/Snapshot.
* In list view new and old snapshot are listed. You can choose snapshot and 
use action button Add volume in selected snapshot to create volume.
 
 (Note: If created snapshot is from shared storage type volume. Volumes are created 
in the same shared technology)
 
*VM-snapshot*

  VM snapshot to preserve all the VM's data volumes as well as (optionally) its 
CPU/memory state. This is useful for quick restore of a VM. 
For example, you can snapshot a VM, then make changes such as software upgrades. 
If anything goes wrong, simply restore the VM to its previous state using the 
previously saved VM snapshot.
The VM snapshot includes not only the data volumes, but optionally also whether 
the VM is running or turned off (CPU state) and the memory contents.
VM snapshots can have a parent/child relationship. Each successive snapshot of 
the same VM is the child of the snapshot that came before it. Each time you take 
an additional snapshot of the same VM, it saves only the differences between the 
current state of the VM and the state stored in the most recent previous 
snapshot. The previous snapshot becomes a parent, and the new snapshot is its 
child. It is possible to create a long chain of these parent/child snapshots, 
which amount to a "redo" record leading from the current state of the VM back 
to the original.

*Limitations on VM Snapshots*

       If a VM has some stored snapshots, you can't attach new volume to the VM 
or delete any existing volumes. If you change the volumes on the VM, it would 
become impossible to restore the VM snapshot which was created with the previous 
volume structure. If you want to attach a volume to such a VM, first delete its 
snapshots.
VM snapshots which include both data volumes and memory can't be kept if you 
change the VM's service offering. Any existing VM snapshots of this type will 
be discarded.
You can't make a VM snapshot at the same time as you are taking a volume 
snapshot.

*Types of Vmsnapshots*

     Vm snapshot have two types
  
      # Snapshot disks
      # Snapshot memory

     By default snapshot disks option is used. It snapshot virtual machine root
    and attached data disk on time.
    
     Snapshot memory option is used to snapshot virtual machine with memory
    and disk status.

*Create vm snapshot*

* Log in to the FogPanel UI.
* In the menu, click cloud/Snapshot/vmsnapshot tab.
* You can choose create vmsnapshot option. It need vm snapshot name,snapshot
Type,instance list then create option.


 *Restore vmsnapshot*

* Log in to the FogPanel UI.
* In the menu, click cloud/Snapshot/vmsnapshot tab.
* In list view new and old snapshot are listed. You can choose snapshot and 
use action button revert to restore vm snapshot


 *Delete vmsnapshot*

* Log in to the FogPanel UI.
* In the menu, click cloud/Snapshot/vmsnapshot.
* In list view new and old snapshot are listed. You can choose snapshot and 
use action button delete to delete it.
