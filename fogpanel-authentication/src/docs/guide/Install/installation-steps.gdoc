1.1 What is FogPanel?
Fogpanel enables cloud builders to move towards an IAAS model by managing and delivering
multiple cloud deployment services through a single and flexible cloud services portal. Organizations
can aggregate any infrastructure, cloud, IT or value added services and enabling users to manage their
accounts through a simple and a self-service portal.

Fogpanel Provides a customized cloudstack billing solutions and development services based on
customer’s Requirements. Thus the billing software has been fashioned to take care of all the
administrative needs.

h3. 1.2 Deployment Architecture Overview

A FogPanel billing software needs atleast minimum cloudstack infrastructure setup. Cloudstack
API key and Secret Key used to integrate with Fogpanel. When you install and setup cloudstack, make
sure high configuration setup for Fogpanel / Management server meets the following minimum
requirements.
You can install both Fogpanel and Cloudstack Management on single server.

*Operating system:*
* Preferred: CentOS/RHEL 6.3+ or Ubuntu 12.04(.1)
* 64-bit x86 CPU (more cores results in better performance)
* 4 GB of memory
* 250 GB of local disk
* At least 1 NIC
* Statically allocated IP address
* Fully qualified domain name as returned by the hostname command.
* Atlest one host hypervisor server which meets the following Minimum requirements:
* Must support HVM (Intel-VT or AMD-V enabled).
* 64-bit x86 CPU (more cores results in better performance)
* Hardware virtualization support required
* 4 GB of memory
* 36 GB of local disk
* At least 1 NIC
* Latest hotfixes applied to hypervisor software
* When you deploy CloudStack, the hypervisor host must not have any VMs already running
* All hosts within a cluster must be homogeneous. The CPUs must be of the same type, count, 
* and feature flags.

*Primary Storage / Secondary Storage requirements.*

    Primary Storage the disk volumes for all of the VMs running on hosts in that cluster. You can add
    multiple primary storage servers to a Zone in future. Secondary storage stores Templates, ISO images
    and Disk volume snapshots. Its available all the hosts in your zone or region.
    Minimum 500G Disk Size Required.
    Mostly these storage connects through iSCSI, NFS servers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
    object storage that are supported by the underlying hypervisor.

*Network Traffic Types*

    Currently Fogpanel 1.0 Supports Basic zone network Traffic types. Your physical network carries
    Management and Guest Traffic in your Basic Network Types. You must add a Direct IP range on the
    pod and make sure IPs are in the same VLAN as the hosts to avoid network conflicts.
    Please refer with cloudstack physical network setup documentation for more information.

*Configure separate server for Fogpanel and Cloudstack Management ( Recommended)*
